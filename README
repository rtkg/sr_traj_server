Trajectory server for the Shadow Hand. Valid hand state trajectories have to be of size 20xN, where
N describes the number of samples. See the example in the /trajectories folder. The joint ordering
has to be:

THJ1
THJ2 
THJ3 
THJ4 
THJ5 
FFJ0 
FFJ3 
FFJ4 
MFJ0 
MFJ3 
MFJ4 
RFJ0 
RFJ3 
RFJ4 
LFJ0 
LFJ3 
LFJ4 
LFJ5 
WRJ1 
WRJ2


The server node publishes on /srh/sendupdate. The default trajectories folder can be specified in
the sr_traj_server.launch file. Run the server via 'roslaunch sr_traj_server
sr_traj_server.launch'. This version of the trajectory server also executes a very simple reactive
force controller - a user can specify contact fingers (valid values are "TH", "FF", "MF", "RF",
"LF"). When a contact finger touches during execution of a trajectory it stops. Once all contact
fingers touch the object, the trajectories of the joints corresponding to the contact fingers
(specified in config/KCL_grasp_config.yaml) are continued until the force value corresponding to any
one contact finger exceeds a given threshold. If no contact is made, the trajectories are simply replayed until the end.

 A service /sr_trajectory_server/replay_traj is provided which expects a string with the local
filename, e.g: rosservice call /sr_traj_server/replay_traj '{file: prismatic_small.txt,
contact_fingers: ["TH","FF","MF"], gf_max: 2}'

Here, prismatic_small.txt is the name of a trajectory in the trajectories folder, contact_fingers
indicates which finger tips are used in the reactive force control and gf_max indicates the force
threshold, i.e., if any force sensor value exceeds gf_max the grasp is seen to be successful.

The hand can be moved back to 0 joint values via rosservice call /sr_traj_server/reset_hand
